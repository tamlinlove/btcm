# Episodic Memory Logs
Episodic memory for the random, serial recall and case study executions are provided here in their respective subdirectories (the executions used to generate results for the paper for the serial recall task are contained in a subdirectory called *multi*).

Episodic memory consists of json files which detail the BT structure, state variables, the value of the state variables at every BT tick and timestep, and the return status and decision of the last executed BT node.
