# Example Prompts
Examples of prompts used in the LLM experiments can be found in this directory, for both the *simple* and *complete* variations.

These prompts are generated programmatically during the experiment as they include episodic memory information which varies from execution to execution. The script that generates the prompts is available [here](../llm_utils.py).
