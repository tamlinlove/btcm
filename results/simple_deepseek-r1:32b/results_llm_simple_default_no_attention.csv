- **UserFrustration=0.8**: High frustration suggests that introducing a higher parameter (7) could increase user stress or impatience. Opting for a lower parameter (6) helps in maintaining user comfort.
- **UserAttention=1**: With attention at 1, there's limited engagement from the user. A lower sequence number might be more suitable to regain focus without overwhelming them.
- **UserReactivity=0**: Zero reactivity indicates that the user is not responding or interacting actively. Choosing a lower parameter ensures the interaction remains manageable and doesn't escalate unnecessarily.
